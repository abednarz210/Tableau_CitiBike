### Population 

## Considerations

* Population density and ridership beginning at Hoboken Terminal at Hudson St. and Hudson Place continue to outperform by mileage.  

* Peak hours for both member and casual riders continue to be between the hours of 5 to 7 pm. Increase resources to increase rider membership versus casual trips at lower-performing stations.

### Ridership

### Considerations

Mileage: Maintenance and Repair crews should be directed to heavily trafficked routes. 

 * Bergan & Stegman Street ending at Lincoln Park 82,852 miles
 * Astor Place to Grove Street Path 53,836 miles 
 * Union St and ending at Grand St 24,849 miles 
 
Maintenance and Repairs: To avoid service disruption maintenance should be performed, when possible from 12 am to 5 am to maximize peak travel times to continue up 
improve the useability and access of Citibike for both membership types.
